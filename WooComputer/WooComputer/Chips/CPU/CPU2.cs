    /**
     * The Central Processing unit (CPU).
     * Consists of an ALU and a set of registers, designed to fetch and 
     * execute instructions written in the Hack machine language.
     * In particular, the ALU executes the inputted instruction according
     * to the Hack machine language specification, as follows. 
     * The D and A in the language specification refer to CPU-resident registers,
     * while M refers to the memory register addressed by A, i.e. to Memory[A].
     * The inM input holds the value of this register. If the current instruction 
     * needs to write a value to M, the value is placed in outM, the address 
     * of the target register is placed in the addressM output, and the 
     * writeM control bit is asserted. (When writeM=0, any value may 
     * appear in outM). The outM and writeM outputs are combinational: 
     * they are affected instantaneously by the execution of the current 
     * instruction. The addressM and pc outputs are clocked: although they 
     * are affected by the execution of the current instruction, they commit 
     * to their new values only in the next time unit. If reset == 1, then the 
     * CPU jumps to address 0 (i.e. sets pc = 0 in next time unit) rather 
     * than to the address resulting from executing the current instruction. 
     */

     A cpu cannot have dynamic width because the logic of the processing is dependdent on how many bits are used in the system
     * so if its a 16 bit system then the logic in the Cycle method will be very dependent on that
